  - Create socket's for multiple client's
    Retive log's thru them
    Use Source-ip adress:port to ommit locks on files



Client  
  - Check is persistance ready
    There gonna be fun in aquiring persistance in JAVA because we ened to escape sandbox, but we can make it


  - Get server IP adress:port from Twitter account immage / Facebook account immage
    If server gives back 404, use other URL where i can post images
    Bootstraping can be handfull for This
