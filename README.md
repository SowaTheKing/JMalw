###This project private learning project, im not responsible for any damage you bad-assess will do with this piece of code.

Quick setup

2 modules
  Server
  Client

Server:
  - On init check config
    Is port for socket free
    Is all directory to save retrived data created and able to write

  - Create socket's for multiple client's
    Retive log's thru them
    Use Source-ip adress:port to ommit locks on files



Client  
  - Check is persistance ready 
    There gonna be fun in aquiring persistance in JAVA because we ened to escape sandbox, but we can make it


  - Get server IP adress:port from Twitter account immage / Facebook account immage
    If server gives back 404, use other URL where i can post images
    Bootstraping can be handfull for This

  - Connect to server
    Only when connection can be established, start gathering data. This is for stealth, if i shut down server, we drop project so none of those grey-gay-hats wont fingerprint mine software

  - OS Detection is required
  - Fingerprint OS
  - Scan installed IDS
  - Replicate keylogger
  - Run keylogger as separate process
  - Persistance keylogger
